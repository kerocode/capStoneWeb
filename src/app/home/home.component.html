          what is regression analysis ?
        </h3>
        <p>
          In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a statistical process for estimating the relationships among variables. It
          includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between
          a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors').

        <h3>How regression analysis is used in forecasting ?</h3>
        <p>
          Regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting, where its use has substantial overlap with the field of
          machine learning. Regression analysis is also used to understand which among the independent variables is related
          to the dependent variable, and to explore the forms of these relationships.

          What is a linear regression model ?
        </h3>
        <p>
          In statistics, linear regression is an approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable y and one
          or more explanatory variables (or independent variables) denoted X. The case of one explanatory variable is called
          simple linear regression.
          <br> It is represented by an equation Y=a+b*X + e, where a is intercept, b is slope of the line and e is error
          term. This equation can be used to predict the value of target variable based on given predictor variable(s).

    <h3>How do regressions work ?</h3>
    <p>
      A regression models the past relationship between variables to predict their future behavior. ... When one independent variable
      is used in a regression, it is called a simple regression; when two or more independent variables are used, it is called
      a multiple regression. Regression models can be either linear or nonlinear.

  <div class="row">
    <h3> what is Ridge Regression ? </h3>
    <p>
      Ridge Regression is a technique used when the data suffers from multicollinearity ( independent variables are highly correlated).
      In multicollinearity, even though the least squares estimates (OLS) are unbiased, their variances are large which deviates
      the observed value far from the true value. By adding a degree of bias to the regression estimates, ridge regression
      reduces the standard errors.
      <br> Above, we saw the equation for linear regression. Remember? It can be represented as:
      <br> y=a+ b*x
      <br> This equation also has an error term. The complete equation becomes:
    </p>
    <pre class="pre">

  y=a+b*x+e (error term),  [error term is the value needed to correct for a prediction error between the observed and predicted value]
<br>
=> y=a+y= a+ b1x1+ b2x2+....+e, for multiple independent variables.
    </pre>
    <p>In a linear equation, prediction errors can be decomposed into two sub components. First is due to the biased and second
      is due to the variance. Prediction error can occur due to any one of these two or both components. Here, weâ€™ll discuss
      about the error caused due to variance.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <h3> what is Lasso Regression ? </h3>
    <p>
      Similar to Ridge Regression, Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) also penalizes the absolute size of
      the regression coefficients. In addition, it is capable of reducing the variability and improving the accuracy of linear
      regression models.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lasso regression differs from ridge regression in a way that it uses absolute values in the penalty function, instead of
      squares. This leads to penalizing (or equivalently constraining the sum of the absolute values of the estimates) values
      which causes some of the parameter estimates to turn out exactly zero. Larger the penalty applied, further the estimates
      get shrunk towards absolute zero. This results to variable selection out of given n variables.
